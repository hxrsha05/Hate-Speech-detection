# 🧠 Hybrid Deep Learning Text Classifier with Streamlit UI
A powerful deep learning-based web app that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Attention Mechanism to classify text into binary categories (e.g., hate speech or not). Built with TensorFlow/Keras, served through an intuitive Streamlit user interface.

# 🚀 Features
⚡ Hybrid Model: CNN for local feature extraction + LSTM for sequential memory + Attention for context focusing.

📊 94%+ Accuracy out of the box (and easily extendable).

🌐 Streamlit Web UI: Clean and interactive interface for testing your models.

📦 Save/Load Models using native .keras or legacy .h5 format.

🧠 Tokenizer Support with pickle for consistent input preprocessing.

🛡️ Handles Imbalanced Datasets (with future options to include SMOTE or class weights).

💬 Custom Text Preprocessing pipeline.

📁 Modular and organized structure for training, saving, and deployment.

def clean_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r"http\S+|@\S+|#\S+|\d+", "", text)
    text = re.sub(r"[^\w\s]", "", text)
    return text.strip()
📚 Dataset Used
You can plug in datasets like:

Hate Speech and Offensive Language

Kaggle Sentiment140

Inspired by recent advancements in NLP with hybrid deep learning.
